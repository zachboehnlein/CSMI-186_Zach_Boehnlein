Evaluation for homework 05: SkateRamp

Only SkateRamp.java is required, you may do all code in one file
Includes running "runtests" function for unit method tests
Includes running automated skateramptests.bat or skateramptests.sh
   View skateramptests.bat to see test parameters used
   Evaluation results are at the bottom of this file
   Current course grade is also at the bottom of the file
Optional second "Integrators.java" file earns one EC point
==============================================================

The SkateRamp.java file must exist.  It must have a main method and needs
to handle at a minimum the "runtests", the "poly", and the "sin" functions
on the command line.  In addition there are argument validations that must
be handled including [5 pts.]:

   - detecting no arguments
   - detecting the correct number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion [e.g., no letters]
   - percentage value set to default if not on command line
   - percentage validated and set properly if it IS on the command line

There may be an optional "Integrators.java" class file to handle the math
of the integrations.  If it exists, that is one EC point.

At minimum, there should be methods to handle the "poly" and the "sin"
integration functions.  Those are worth one point each.  Any other methods
for integrating other functions earn one EC point each, with no maximum.
If the two required methods are actually done in the main as part of the
"switch" or "if-else" statement, that is fine, they still earn the points,
with the caveat that it is better to make them methods next time.

The "runMyTests" method must exist and must allow for the tests to be run
using the command line "pseudo-function" called "runmytests".  There must
be AT LEAST one test for each of the functions that are implemented, which
means a minimum of three: validateArgs(), poly(), and sin(). [3 pts.]

Testing will be done using the script files that were shown to you during
the development of your project.  There are 6 tests for input validity,
worth 6 points.  There are 5 tests for up to 2nd degree polynomials, for
another 5 points, and one test for a 5th order polynomial, worth one
point.  There are 5 tests for the sin function, worth a total of 5 points.
There are tests included for cos, tan, sqrt, log, and exp, just to see if
they run; however, the credit is for the implementation of the functions
so getting the right answer AND implementing the function code gives a
TOTAL of one point.

There must be at least one file in the repo: the Riemann.java file.

Your source code style is important for this project, and will continue
to be so for the rest of the semester.  Make sure you indent properly
and consistently, that your variables have good names, there is NO code
that is left in that is not needed [commented out], and that you have
comments to help explain what the code does without being overly
loquatious.

A total of one point each for the following, except where noted:

SkateRamp.java          : exists and compiles               - 1/1 point
validations method      : exists                            - 1/1 point
main method             : runs properly, no errors          - 1/1 point
runMyTests method       : exists, tests three methods       - 1/1 points

Integrators class [EC]  : if it exists/compiles [optional]  - 0/1 point EC

Integrate polynomials   : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point
Integrate sine          : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point

Integrate cosine        : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point EC
Integrate tangent       : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point EC
Integrate log           : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point EC
Integrate exp           : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point EC
Integrate sq. root      : method exists in some file        - 1/1 point EC
Integrate compos.       : method exists in some file        - 0/1 point EC

runmytests method       : method tests two required func.   - 2/2 point
tests input valid       : passes all six checks             - 5/6 points
tests for 2nd deg poly  : gets [nearly] correct on 5 tests  - 5/5 points
test for 5th deg poly   : gets [nearly] correct on test     - 1/1 point
test for sin            : gets [nearly] correct on tests    - 5/5 points
SkateRamp.java in repo  : one file [gimme]                  - 1/1 point
Coding style            : as noted in text above            - 5/5 points

Total of required activities: 31 out of 31 = 100% which is an A-plus

It is possible to get more than 100% on this assignment.  The total percent
will be applied to the 15% that this exercise is worth overall.  For example,
if you earn the maximum credit, you will get 38 out of 31, which is 123.33%.

Seven EC points added to total:  38 out of 31 = 122.58% which is an A-plus

Detailed comments:
==================
Nice job on this one Zach!  You missed a couple of argument error checks,
but you got pretty close results on most of the outputs.  Everything ran to
completion, too.


Your score: 35 out of 31.0 = 112.90% which is an A-plus.

For the semester you have:
   homework00:    5.00
   homework01:    5.00
   homework02:    5.00
   homework03:   10.00
   homework04:    9.73
   homework05:   16.94
   -------------------
        total:   51.67 out of 50 which is 103.33% which is an A-plus


AWESOME SAUCE!  Keep up the great work, Zach!
