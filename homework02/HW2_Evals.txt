Evaluation for homework 02: PiSolver

PiSolver.java program
   Includes running automated PiSolver tests
============================================

The PiSolver.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
makes a call to "super()".  There must be a "main()" method that runs the
simluation of the number of darts which are obtained from the command
line argument.  If no argument is given on the command line, there should
be an error message or usage message generated before the program quits.
For this program, error checking of the argument number is not required.

There must be a loop which executes the number of times that have been
given from the command line argument.  Either in the loop or in a separate
method [e.g. "dartThrow()"] the value of the hypotenuse of the triangle
formed from the X and Y values calculated for each throw must be calculated
and used to determine if the dart is inside or outside the circle.  There
are ten tests run which each count one point


A total of one point each for the following, except where noted:

PiSolver.java compiles  : works            -  1 point
constructor()           : works            -  1 point
inputHandling           : works            -  1 point
calculation()           : works            -  1 point
tests correct (10 pts)  : passes all tests - 10 points
One file in repo        : one present      -  1 point
Coding Style            : indenting, names -  1 point

Total possible 16 out of 16 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score:
Your total 16 out of 16 = 100% which is an A-plus


Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
Very nice, Zach!

Make sure your indenting is consistent, especially with the curly braces that
close blocks.  It can be confusing to the reader when the blocks aren't quite
aligned, and it increases the likelihood that there will be something missing
that will cause a compile error that is VERY hard to track down.

Otherwise, excellent work!
