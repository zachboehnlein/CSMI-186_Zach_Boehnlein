======================================================

The Ball.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor that
takes at least four arguments for the x, y, dx, and dy values.  There
must be some sort of "move()" method.  There may be some sort of
"updateSpeed()" method but the computation may be done in move() with
no penalty.  There must be a "toString()" method to display the info
about the ball's location and speed.  There should be an "outOfBounds()"
method, but the computation may be done in the SoccerSim class instead.

The Timer.java or Clock.java class is optional.  If it exists, there is
one point each for the methods listed and any tests included.  Otherwise
this is a freebie, but the functionality of the computations MUST show
up in the SoccerSim.java class file somewhere/somehow.

The SoccerSim.java class must exist.  There needs to be a constructor
that initializes the simulation.  If the initialization is done in some
other method, that is OK, and credit is given for the constructor.  There
must be some method of validating arguments.  This may be done using the
provided method "validateArgs()" or can be done in the main() method if
that is desired.  There must be some kind of report facility, which can
be either a method "report()" [or similar name], or can be done directly
in the simulation loop in another way.  There needs to be a facility to
detect collisions, which may be either a method like "collisionCheck()"
or can be done directly in the simulation loop.  There must be a main()
method which takes in and handles the argument checking, either directly
or through a method call to something like "validateArgs()".  There are
four points total [1 point for each] awarded for argument checking, which
covers:

   - right number of arguments
   - arguments are of correct type after conversion (no letters)
   - time slice set to default if not on command line
   - time slice validated and set properly if it IS on the command line

Testing includes trials that should show ball[s] come to rest, should
show two balls colliding, and three others to show the balls all go off
the field, all come to a stop, and various ball counts are handled in
the output; the last three are worth a total of three points.

There must be at least two files in the repo: the Ball.java and the
SoccerSim.java files.  If there is a Timer/Clock.java file it is
ignored for credit since it was optional, AS LONG AS THE FUNCTIONALITY
IS AVAILABLE in one of the other two classes.

A total of one point each for the following, except where noted:

main(tests)             : one point if there are any done   - 1 point
                          zero points if there are none
                          1/2 point if they don't work properly

Total 36 points possible:

YOUR SCORE:  37 out of 37 = 100% which is an A-plus

Detailed omments:
=================
You did great on this, Zach!  The only thing missing is the time stamp that
should appear at the top of each output report.

One suggestion is to put a little more space between the "fields" of your
output so that the user can see the values a little more easily.

Nice work on the assignment, now time to kick ass on SkateRamp!
