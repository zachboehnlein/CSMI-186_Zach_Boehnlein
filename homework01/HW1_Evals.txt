Evaluation for homework01: music mashup

============================================

Straighten out the pictures into the correct artist subdirectories,
then straighten out the artist subdirectories into the "proper"
genre subdirectories.

Genre subdirectories are based on your own opinion of what genre the
artist belongs with.  Although my solution involves a 1-to-1 matching
of an artist with a genre, you are welcome to add them into whatever
multiple categories you choose.

You must also include a file that contains the commands you used on the
command line.  The commands will most likely be the common ones like
"move" or "mv", "copy" or "cp", "mkdir", "rmdir", and "del" or "rm", but
you may have many others as well.

Point totals are as follows:

command file submitted  :  1 point
reorganized hierarchy   :  5 points

Total 6 out of 6 = 100% which is an A-plus

Your score:
Total 6 out of 6 = 100% which is an A-plus

----------------------------------
Nice work on this, you got everything unscrambled and have a great-looking
command list file!
