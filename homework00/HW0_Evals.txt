Evaluation for homework 00: Greeter
   and Java Environment set up
   and GitHub repository set up/initialization
============================================

There must be a GitHub repository to which you have invited your humble
professor to collaborate.  The structure of the repository must be as is
specified in the assignment, including the name of the repo.  There must
be a "Greeter.java" source code file in the repository.  You do not need
to include the "Greeter.class" file unless you want to do so.  It will
be assumed that you have a working editor of some kind to create your
code and that it is configured correctly [no "funny" characters].  It will
also be assumed that you have a working Java installation so that your
compiler and JVM can execute your code.

============================================================================
Evaluation:
============================================================================
Maximum points: 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus

Java works        1.00 out of 1.00
Repo created      2.00 out of 2.00
Editor works      1.00 out of 1.00
Greeter runs      2.00 out of 2.00
Greeter in Repo   2.00 out of 2.00

Your score:
Total 8 out of 8 = 100% which is an A-plus


Explicit comments on the exercise:
----------------------------------
One subtle note: don't be afraid to "open up" your code a bit for the sake
of readability.  It is easier to read code that has blank lines in some
appropriate places.


Nice work!
